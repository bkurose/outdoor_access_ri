                This website is for <b>ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY</b>. In it's current form, this website is NOT intended for use by the public, but is rather supposed to be a demonstration of the skills learned at the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp. <b>It is not intended to actually direct anyone, anywhere, or advise on the legal aspects surrounding coatal access.</b> Any injury or harm that comes as a result of usage of the site is not the responsibility of Outdoor Access Rhode Island or it's creator. 
                <br/>
                <br/>The Outdoor Access Rhode Island application does have the ability for users to post comments and other data to the website. Outdoor Access Rhode Island and it's creator cannot be held liable for the content that other users may add after public deployment. I will make efforts periodically to check user generated data and to clear the database of any posts that are problematic, offensive, inappropriate, or just unkind. If you notice data that should be removed from the website feel free to contact me directly at ben.kurose@gmail.com and I will attempt to respond promptly. <b>NOTE: I will NOT remove any CRMC designated ROWs, or other offical public access points.</b> If you have a personal reason to discourage folks from accessing these areas I suggest you bring it up with your town or at the next CRMC meeting.
                <br/>
                <br/>Application is NOT designed for mass distribution. No infringement is intended on any existing applications; I have attempted to create something familiar with the user interface yet unique in it's application and design. This website is for education and entertainment purposes and <b>will not be deployed commerically.</b> If you intend to distribute this website for widespread use, please contact me first; again, it is currently <b>NOT DESIGNED FOR MASS DISTRIBUTION!</b>  
                <br/>
                <br/>We encourage you to enjoy all the fun and wonder of the outdoors<b> at your own risk.</b> As always, if you're going to enjoy the great outdoors, please do so carefully and plan ahead. Rhode Island has tons of amazing coastline and we hope everyone gets a chance to enjoy it.
                <br/>
                <br/>Finally, a special recognition to the fine folks at Leaflet and OpenStreetMap for allowing me free usage of their software and APIs. Without their services and complete documentation, this website would not have been possible. Additionally, I would like to thank the CRMC for making accessible the data on their many ROWs throughout the state.
